						You may well ask: “How can I start using <abbr>HTML5</abbr> if older browsers don’t support it?” But <br>the question itself is misleading. <abbr>HTML5</abbr> is not one big thing; it is a collection of individual <br>features. So you can’t detect “<abbr>HTML5</abbr> support,” because that doesn’t make any sense. But <br>you <em>can</em> detect support for individual features, like canvas, video, or geolocation.
						<br><br>
						You may think of <abbr>HTML</abbr> as tags and angle brackets. That’s an important part of it, but it’s <br>
						not the whole story. The <abbr>HTML5</abbr> specification also defines how those angle brackets <br>interact with JavaScript, through the Document Object Model (<abbr>DOM</abbr>). <abbr>HTML5</abbr> doesn’t just <br> define a <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag; there is also a corresponding <abbr>DOM</abbr> <abbr>API</abbr> for video objects in the <abbr>DOM</abbr>. You can use this <abbr>API</abbr> to detect support for different video formats, play a video, pause, mute audio, track how much of the video has been downloaded, and everything else you need to build a rich user experience around the <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag itself.
						<br><br>
						<a href = "#">Chapter 2</a> and <a href = "#">Appendix A</a> will teach you how to properly detect support for each new <abbr>HTML5</abbr> feature.

						Love it or hate it, you can’t deny that <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4 is the most successful markup format ever. <abbr>HTML5</abbr> builds on that success. You don’t need to throw away your existing markup. You don’t need to relearn things you already know. If your web application worked yesterday in <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4, it will still work today in <abbr>HTML5</abbr>. Period.
						<br><br>
						Now, if you want to <em>improve</em> your web applications, you’ve come to the right place. Here’s a concrete example: <abbr>HTML5</abbr> supports all the form controls from <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4, but it also includes new input controls. Some of these are long-overdue additions like sliders and date pickers; others are more subtle. For example, the <code>email</code> input type looks just like a text box, but mobile browsers will customize their onscreen keyboard to make it easier to type email addresses. Older browsers that don’t support the <code>email</code> input type will treat it as a regular text field, and the form still works with no markup changes or scripting hacks. This means you can start improving your web forms <em>today</em>, even if some of your visitors are stuck on IE 6.

						“Upgrading” to <abbr>HTML5</abbr> can be as simple as changing your <i>doctype</i>. The doctype should already be on the first line of every <abbr>HTML</abbr> page. Previous versions of <abbr>HTML</abbr> defined a lot <br> of doctypes, and choosing the right one could be tricky. In <abbr>HTML5</abbr>, there is only one <br> doctype:
						
						<blockquote>
						<p><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code></p>
						</blockquote>

						Upgrading to the <abbr>HTML5</abbr> doctype won’t break your existing markup, because <a href = "#">obsolete elements</a> previously defined in HTML 4 will still render in <abbr>HTML5</abbr>. But it will allow you <br> to use — and validate — new semantic elements like <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>. You’ll learn all about these new elements in <a href = "#">Chapter 3</a>.

						Whether you want to draw on a canvas, play video, design better forms, or build web applications that work offline, you’ll find that <abbr>HTML5</abbr> is already well-supported. Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Opera, and mobile browsers already support canvas (<a href = "#">Chapter 4</a>), video (<a href = "#">Chapter 5</a>), geolocation (<a href = "#">Chapter 6</a>), local storage (<a href = "#">Chapter 7</a>), and more. Google already supports microdata annotations (<a href = "#">Chapter 10</a>). Even Microsoft — rarely known for blazing the trail of standards support — supports most <abbr>HTML5</abbr> features in Internet Explorer 9.

This book will teach you how to <br>  target the native features of modern browsers, without leaving older browsers behind.

						Tim Berners-Lee invented the world wide web in the early 1990s. He later founded the <abbr>W3C</abbr> to act as a steward of web standards, which the organization has done for more than 15 years. Here is what the <abbr>W3C</abbr> had to say about the future of <br> web standards, in July 2009:
						<br>
							<blockquote style = "line-height: 1.7; word-spacing: 2px;">
								Today the Director announces that when the <abbr>XHTML</abbr> 2 Working Group charter expires as scheduled at the end of 2009, the charter will not be renewed. By doing so, and by increasing resources in the <abbr>HTML</abbr> Working Group, <br><abbr>W3C</abbr> hopes to accelerate the progress of <abbr>HTML5</abbr> and clarify <abbr>W3C</abbr>’s position regarding the future of <abbr>HTML</abbr>.
